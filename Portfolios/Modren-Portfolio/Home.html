                    Greetings! I am <span>Prathyush Varrey</span>, and I believe you have a keen interest in my profile. 
                    As a recent graduate, I successfully completed my Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science from JNTU Kakinada. 
                     I achieved an aggregate score of 6.57 out of 10.
                     If you're curious about my skills, I have compiled a selection  for you to explore.
                     <br> <br>     
                     In pursuit of delivering my best at work, I have embarked on enhancing my skill set. At the moment, my main focus is Front-End Development, and in the near future, I intend to shift my attention to the Back-End aspect. Notably, I have devoted significant effort to mastering the MERN Stack Technology. 
                     <br> <br>
                     This sets me apart from others. However, in the era of AI evolution, many people argue that Front-End / Full-Stack developers face certain drawbacks, specifically in dealing with edge cases that only a human can comprehend, not an AI. AI is a powerful tool that expedites our work, and those who utilize it effectively will thrive, while those who struggle to do so may encounter challenges.
